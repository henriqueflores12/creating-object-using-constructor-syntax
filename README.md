# creating-object-using-constructor-syntax

here one simple example of object constructor syntax
the empty object called hotel is created using the constructor
once it has been created three properties and a method are them assigned to the object
if the object alredy had any of these properties
this would overwrite the values in those properties.
to access a property of this object you can use dot notation
just as you can with any object
for example to get the hotel's name you could use
hotel.name
similarly to use the method yo can use the object name followed by the method name:hotel.checkAvailability();
